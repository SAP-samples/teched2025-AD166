# Exercise 7 - Add a Second View with Navigation

Your customer does not only want to have a broad overview of all their icehouses. In case of an error they'd like to inspect a sensor for recent temperature data. You'll add a second view to display more available data.

## Create a new view using 'Joule'
Below you will find instructions on how to create a view manually. As an alternative, you can try creating your view using Joule.

1. Click on the 'Joule' symbol in the left side pane. You should see the 'Joule' chat panel.
<br><br>![](images/07_01_001.png)<br><br>

2.  Start your prompt with the command `/ui5-create-page` and add additional input such as the name of the view and any specific information.

    A good example for a prompt in this tutorial step would be:

    ```text
    Please create a new view and controller named SensorStatus. Additionally, add the corresponding routing information to the application's manifest file (manifest.json). You may add new code to the existing files Sensor.view.xml and Sensor.controller.ts, but ensure that no existing code in these files is removed.
    ```

    Feel free to experiment with the prompt and Joule.

    It may take a moment to receive a response, but you should see a similar result as shown in the screenshot below.

1. Now you can decide whether you want to apply the suggested change or whether you want to refine or ignore it.
<br><br>![](images/07_01_002.png)<br><br>

1. Within the tutorial, it's necessary to go through the steps below and check the created code. This is essential because the result of the prompt can vary, and to ensure that the further tutorial steps are still valid, it's necessary to sync your created code with the tutorial.

> [!NOTE]
> There are currently three UI5-related Joule commands. You can also use `/ui5` to ask Joule to explain specific UI5 coding, or use `/ui5-typescript` to get help migrating your UI5 JavaScript project to TypeScript.

## Exercise 7.1 - Create SensorStatus.view.xml

Create a new view as follows:

1. Go to folder `keepcool.sensormanager/webapp/view/`.

2. Right-click on the `view` folder and select `New File`.

1. Enter `SensorStatus.view.xml` as file name.
<br><br>![](images/07_01_003.png)<br><br>

1. Add an empty `sap.m.Page` to the newly created view.

    ***keepcool.sensormanager/webapp/view/SensorStatus.view.xml***

    ```xml
    <mvc:View
        displayBlock="true"
        xmlns:mvc="sap.ui.core.mvc"
        xmlns="sap.m">
        <Page
            id="SensorStatusPage"
            title="{i18n>titleSensorStatus}"
            showNavButton="true">
        </Page>
    </mvc:View>
    ```

## Exercise 7.2 - Configure the `manifest.json` file

After creating the new view, you'll next add routing information for it to the `manifest.json` file.

1. Open `keepcool.sensormanager/webapp/manifest.json`.

2. Go to section `sap.ui5` / `routing` / `routes`.

3. Add a new entry to the `routes` configuration. Note that the new route contains a patch segment in brackets: `{index}`. This will later pass the currently selected sensor as a parameter in the browser hash.

    ***keepcool.sensormanager/webapp/manifest.json***

    ```json
                    {
                        "name": "sensorStatus",
                        "pattern": "sensor/{index}",
                        "target": ["sensorStatus"]
                    }
    ```

4. Go to section `sap.ui5` / `routing` / `targets`.

5. Add a new entry to the `targets` configuration. Here, you need to pass `SensorStatus` as the `viewName`.

    ***keepcool.sensormanager/webapp/manifest.json***

    ```json
                    "sensorStatus": {
                        "viewId": "sensorStatus",
                        "viewName": "SensorStatus",
                        "viewLevel": 2
                    }
    ```

6. *OPTIONAL*: Let's see if the newly created view can be opened. Switch to the browser tab with the opened application preview. Add `#/sensor/0` at the end of the URL in the browser's location bar and open that URL (The UI5 application is refreshed, and the newly created page is displayed.
<br><br>![](images/07_01_004.png)<br><br>

## Exercise 7.3 - Implement the Navigation to the New View

Great! You can access the newly created view. Next, you need to implement logic to navigate from your first view to the newly created one.

1. Open `keepcool.sensormanager/webapp/controller/Sensors.controller.ts`.

2. Create the function `navToSensorStatus`. Here, you get the index of the currently selected sensor and navigate to the new view by passing the index.

    ***keepcool.sensormanager/webapp/controller/Sensors.controller.ts***

    ```ts
        navToSensorStatus(event: ListItemBase$PressEvent): void {
            const sensorIndex = (event.getSource() as Control).getBindingContext("sensorModel")?.getProperty("index") as number;
            this.navTo("sensorStatus", {index: sensorIndex});
        }
    ```

The `BaseController`, that was generated by Easy-UI5, offers a `navTo` function, simplifying the navigation logic that needs to be implemented from your side.

## Exercise 7.4 - Assign the Navigation Logic to the Sensor Items

After implementing the navigation logic you'll need to assign it to a control, so it can be triggered by the user.

1. Open `keepcool.sensormanager/webapp/view/Sensors.view.xml`.

2. Add the `press` event to the `sap.m.CustomListItem` control and assign the newly created function.

    ***keepcool.sensormanager/webapp/view/Sensors.view.xml***

    ```xml
                                <CustomListItem
                                    type="Active"
                                    press=".navToSensorStatus">
    ```

3. Let's see if the navigation logic works. Switch to the browser tab with the opened application preview. In the URL, remove any content after `index.html`. Reload the page. Click any sensor. The navigation takes place, and you see the newly created view.
<br><br>![](images/07_01_004.png)<br><br>

## Exercise 7.5 - Create SensorStatus.controller.ts
Nice. Now let's implement the navigation back to `Sensors.view.xml`. To do this, you'll need a new controller for the newly created view.

1. Go to folder `keepcool.sensormanager/webapp/controller/`.

2. Right-click on the `controller` folder and select `New File`.

3. Enter `SensorStatus.controller.ts` as file name.
<br><br>![](images/07_01_006.png)<br><br>

4. Copy and paste the controller definition given below into the newly created `SensorStatus.controller.ts`.

    ***keepcool.sensormanager/webapp/controller/SensorStatus.controller.ts***

    ```ts
    import BaseController from "./BaseController";

    /**
     * @namespace keepcool.sensormanager.controller
     */
    export default class SensorStatus extends BaseController {

        public onInit(): void {

        }
    }
    ```

5. Open `keepcool.sensormanager/webapp/view/SensorStatus.view.xml`.

6. Using the `controllerName` attribute, assign the newly created controller to the view.

    ```xml
    <mvc:View
        controllerName="keepcool.sensormanager.controller.SensorStatus"
        displayBlock="true"
        xmlns:mvc="sap.ui.core.mvc"
        xmlns="sap.m">
    ```

## Exercise 7.6 - Implement the Back-Navigation to Sensors.view.xml

Next you need to implement the navigation logic. You can use another functionality, that is provided by the `BaseController`, the convenience event handler `onNavBack`.

1. Open `keepcool.sensormanager/webapp/view/SensorStatus.view.xml`.

4. Add the `navButtonPress` event to the `sap.m.Page` control and assign the newly created `onNavBack` function to it.

    ***keepcool.sensormanager/webapp/view/SensorStatus.view.xml***

    ```xml
        <Page
            id="SensorStatusPage"
            title="{i18n>titleSensorStatus}"
            showNavButton="true"
            navButtonPress="onNavBack">
        </Page>
    ```

5. Let's see if the navigation logic works. Switch to the browser tab with the opened application preview. In the URL, remove any content after `index.html`. Reload the page.
<br><br>![](images/07_01_007.png)<br><br>

6. Click any sensor. The navigation takes place, and you see the newly created view.
<br><br>![](images/07_01_008.png)<br><br>

7. Click the "<" button to navigate back to the sensor list. Thanks to how the Router works, you can also use the "Back" button of the browser or your mobile device instead.
