# AD166 - Taking UI to the next level: Develop SAPUI5 with SAP Build

## Description

This repository contains the material for the SAP TechEd 2025 session called AD166 - Taking UI to the next level: Develop SAPUI5 with SAP Build.

## Exercises

By completing these exercises, you'll gain hands-on experience in developing web applications using the **SAPUI5** framework and **TypeScript**. Furthermore, you'll discover how to seamlessly integrate **UI5 Web Components** into your SAPUI5 application.

In the last exercise, you will learn how to use the **UI5 Linter** to ensure your application follows the latest best practices.

From the list, you can not only access each exercise directly, but also browse the resulting sources and run the resulting app.
